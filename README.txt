This is a demo web application that contains a simple cash flow tracking system. Users can enter expenses and income, and see a chart of their cashflow change in real time. I build this application to become familiar with Angular.js and Laravel.


Included features are:

User Registration.
Password Reset Mechanism.
AJAX based CSRF tokens co-operating with Angular.js and Laravel.
Multiple Angular.js controllers on one page.
